            How to start a product or service? How to find the right fit? How to hopefully scale it? How to decide and
            when to choose among all the available frameworks, methodologies, processes? Lean? Design thinking? Agile?
            Growth? Scrum? Kanban?… <br>
            Allow me to offer some suggestions. The set of processes we adopted at Pentalog is not a silver bullet,
            neither a religious mantra. But it does help to save time, money, energy, and to get your idea off the
            ground, then to scale if you find your Product-Market Fit. And eventually, to grow a great business.
            <br><br>
            So, you have an idea. You think the idea is terrific. You want to build as fast as possible. The market is
            just going to love it. But you don’t have all the time and money in the world. And, let me break the news to
            you, it is probably not going to happen the way you’d like. Now what?

        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">From Prototype to Product-Market Fit. This phase has three stages. It goes from the idea
            stage
            whereyou build a prototype. Then time to ship the first version of your product [MVP (Minimum Viable
            Product) or MVO (Minimum Viable Outcome)]. And finally, you either pivot or look for a Product-Market Fit
            (PMF). At this last stage, you start to understand your funnel, the needs of your audience, their pain
            points. You have a good value proposition, a North Star, a growth model. You have several hypotheses on the
            “wow” moment…</p>
